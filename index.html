		<p>To do</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Code review
				<ul>
					<li>Compare the core functions setup, redraw, in all four views</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Data review</li>
			<li>Outstanding comments from Martha/Rebecca</li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
		-->

		<p>Testing</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Review ETL code for different scenarios (DY, overall, other)</li>
			<li>We rely on the ETL code to generate a consistent data format so that we can reuse overlapping code -- verify that the data structures are indeed identical where needed</li>
			<li>Review data for implicit missings and all kinds of explicit missings -- are these handled properly in the current code?</li>

Employment data are shown for the three age groups overall and by race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and sex. This feature also provides data on "disconnected youth:" young people between the ages of 16 and 24 who are neither working nor in school and are at increased risk of subsequent unemployment and poverty.', 

		'<span class="metro-interactive-header-text">Definitions</span>',

		'The <b>unemployment rate</b> refers to the share of the population that is actively looking for work. It measures the extent to which people are unsuccessfully job-searching. However, it does not include people who are out of work and would like a job but are discouraged and not searching. It may underestimate labor market problems, since a low unemployment rate may reflect that fewer people are looking for work, not that more people are finding jobs. The <b>employment rate</b>, also known as the employment-to-population ratio, measures the share of the non-institutionalized population that is employed. A high employment rate indicates that jobs are plentiful and people can find work. In short, the unemployment rate reflects active interest in working, and the employment rate reflects whether people are actually working.',

		'While there is broad agreement that the terms "<b>disconnected youth</b>" or "opportunity youth" refers to young people not working and not in school, there is not a standard methodology or data source to create estimates of the number of such youth or their characteristics. Thus, different reports are likely to produce different figures, based on the use of different data sources and definitions. In this analysis, people are considered disconnected if they meet the following criteria: they are between the ages of 16–24, not working, not enrolled in school, living below 200 percent of the federal poverty line, with an educational attainment of less than an associate degree, not in the Armed Forces, and not living in group quarters. For more information, please see the Methodology section of the report.']);
