School is likely to be teens’ primary activity until high school graduation, but early work experiences (part-time and in the summers) can provide valuable opportunities for teens to learn new skills, gain experience, expand their networks, and develop positive relationships with adults. Young adults are typically in a different phase and engage in a broader mix of activities. Some continue in school full-time, some combine work and school, and others work full-time, or would like to do so.", 

		"This analysis measures rates of employment, unemployment, and disconnected youth using microdata data from the American Community Survey covering the years 2008 through 2014.", 

		"The unemployment rate refers to the share of the population that is actively looking for work, and is one of the most closely watched measures of the economy. It captures the extent to which people are unsuccessfully job-searching. However, the unemployment rate does not include people who are out of work and would like a job but have gotten discouraged and given up searching. Thus, it may underestimate labor market problems. A low unemployment rate may not reflect that more people are finding jobs, but rather that fewer people are looking for work. By contrast, the employment rate refers to the share of the population that has a job. A high employment rate indicates that jobs are plentiful and people can find work. In short, the unemployment rate reflects active interest in working, and the employment rate reflects whether people are actually working.", 

		"The analysis also examines a key subpopulation among teens and young adult population:  so-called “disconnected youth,” those who are neither working nor in school. These young people are missing key educational and employment experiences and are at increased risk for a host of negative outcomes: long spells of unemployment, poverty, criminal behavior, substance abuse, and incarceration [1].  Data on disconnected youth also comes from American Community Survey microdata, but to compensate for small sample sizes, the analysis uses a three-year estimate encompassing the years 2012-2014."]);
