+ Make state tracking a per-view thing - Done (2/17) -- NEED TO TEST
+ Add legends to map
+ Enhance the view menu
+ limit 
+ add in the error message
+ revise to allow loading, caching of data without drawing
+ review the timing of the TOCShow, to make sure the var is set properly at all times that the minimum possible number of calls to viewMenuCtrl.show/hide are made.
+ review the slide transition -- especially no longer setting S.viewWrap height explicitely.
+ add functionality to scroll view back to top when showing view, in case the user has done so from the bottom of the menu

+review the basic height paradigm. height is set on viewwrap to match the shown view. the TOC height is set to be between 100% of current viewWrap height and the max view height. review this scheme, especially where height is refreshed.
++keep in mind that when toc is shown, resize does not redraw any views
